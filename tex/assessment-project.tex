\section*{Assessment Overview}
In this assessment, you will develop \& publish a travelling application using \textbf{Kotlin} in \textbf{Android Studio} \& \textbf{Google Play Store}. \textbf{Android} features such as \textbf{ViewModel}, \textbf{LiveData}, \textbf{Room Database} \& \textbf{Google Map} were formally covered in the teaching sessions. The main purpose of this assessment is not just to build a mobile application, rather to demonstrate your ability to effectively learn intermediate/advanced \textbf{Android} \& application development features independently. In addition, marks will be allocated for code elegance, documentation \& \textbf{Git/GitHub} usage. \\

The travelling application will help you sound like a local abroad \& help you adapt to a new culture. You will begin by selecting a \href{https://www.worldometers.info/geography/7-continents/}{continent} \& country tool. For example, if you were to travel to Spain, you would be provided with text translation \& text to speech support, a selection of key Spanish phrases, an interactive quiz to test your knowledge of Spanish culture \& a map containing locations of top-rated tourist Spanish attractions. A user of your travelling application must be able to select from at least two country tools per continent \textbf{excluding} Antarctica.

\section*{Learning Outcomes}
At the successful completion of this course, learners will be able to:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Implement \& publish complete, non-trivial, industry-standard mobile applications following sound architectural \& code-quality standards.
	\item Identify relevant use cases for a mobile computing scenario \& incorporate them into an effective user experience design.
	\item Follow industry standard software engineering practice in the design of mobile applications.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Conditions of Assessment}
You will complete this assessment during your learner managed time, however, there will be availability during the teaching sessions to discuss the requirements \& your progress of this assessment. This assessment will need to be completed by \textbf{Tuesday, 22 June 2021 at 5:00 PM}.

\section*{Pass Criteria}
This assessment is criterion-referenced (CRA) with a cumulative pass mark of \textbf{50\%} over all assessments in \textbf{IN721: Mobile Application Development}.

\section*{Authenticity}
All parts of your submitted assessment must be completely your work \& any references must be cited appropriately including, externally-sourced graphic elements. Provide your references in a \textbf{README.md} file. All media must be royalty free (or legally purchased) for educational use. Failure to do this will result in a mark of \textbf{zero} for this assessment.

\section*{Policy on Submissions, Extensions, Resubmissions \& Resits}
The school's process concerning submissions, extensions, resubmissions \& resits complies with \textbf{Otago Polytechnic} policies. Learners can view policies on the \textbf{Otago Polytechnic} website located at \href{https://www.op.ac.nz/about-us/governance-and-management/policies}{https://www.op.ac.nz/about-us/governance-and-management/policies}.

\section*{Submissions}
You must submit all program files via \textbf{GitHub Classroom}. Here is the link to the repository you will use for your submission – \href{https://classroom.github.com/a/FWk\_XkTA}{https://classroom.github.com/a/FWk\_XkTA}. The latest program files in the \textbf{main} branch will be used to run your application. Late submissions will incur a \textbf{10\% penalty per day}, rolling over at \textbf{5:00 PM}.

\section*{Extensions}
Familiarise yourself with the assessment due date. If you need an extension, contact the course lecturer before the due date. If you require more than a week's extension, a medical certificate or support letter from your manager may be needed.

\section*{Resubmissions}
Learners may be requested to resubmit an assessment following a rework of part/s of the original assessment. Resubmissions are to be completed within a negotiable short time frame \& usually must be completed within the timing of the course to which the assessment relates. Resubmissions will be available to learners who have made a genuine attempt at the first assessment opportunity \& achieved a \textbf{D grade (40-49\%)}. The maximum grade awarded for resubmission will be \textbf{C-}.

\section*{Resits}
Resits \& reassessments are not applicable in \textbf{IN721: Mobile Application Development}. 

\section*{Post-Assessment Evaluation}
As part of this assessment, you will be required to organise a meeting with the course lecturer to discuss your feedback. The meeting will be conducted after you receive your assessment result. This post-assessment evaluation will \textbf{not} be graded.
