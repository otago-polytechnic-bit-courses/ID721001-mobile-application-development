\section*{Assessment Overview}
In this assessment, you will research, prepare \& present a mobile-related topic. The information presented must be in a \textbf{README.md} file. Also, you need to provide a code example to accompany the \textbf{README.md} file. The main purpose of this assessment is to demonstrate your ability to identify and effectively articulate an intermediate/advanced topic in \textbf{Android}.

\section*{Learning Outcomes}
At the successful completion of this course, learners will be able to:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Implement \& publish complete, non-trivial, industry-standard mobile applications following sound architectural \& code-quality standards.
	\item Identify relevant use cases for a mobile computing scenario \& incorporate them into an effective user experience design.
	\item Follow industry standard software engineering practice in the design of mobile applications.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Conditions of Assessment}
You will complete this assessment during your learner managed time, however, there will be availability during the weekly meetings to discuss the requirements \& your progress of this assessment. This assessment will need to be completed by \textbf{Tuesday, 21 June 2022} at \textbf{5 PM}.

\section*{Pass Criteria}
This assessment is criterion-referenced (CRA) with a cumulative pass mark of \textbf{50\%} over all assessments in \textbf{ID721001: Mobile Application Development}.

\section*{Authenticity}
All parts of your submitted assessment \textbf{must} be completely your work \& any references \textbf{must} be cited appropriately including, externally-sourced graphic elements. Provide your references in a \textbf{README.md} file. All media \textbf{must} be royalty free (or legally purchased) for educational use. Failure to do this will result in a mark of \textbf{zero} for this assessment.

\section*{Policy on Submissions, Extensions, Resubmissions \& Resits}
The school's process concerning submissions, extensions, resubmissions \& resits complies with \textbf{Otago Polytechnic} policies. Learners can view policies on the \textbf{Otago Polytechnic} website located at \href{https://www.op.ac.nz/about-us/governance-and-management/policies}{https://www.op.ac.nz/about-us/governance-and-management/policies}.

\section*{Submissions}
You \textbf{must} submit all presentation files via \textbf{GitHub Classroom}. Here is the URL to the repository you will use for your submission - \href{https://classroom.github.com/a/Pfexjhjb}{https://classroom.github.com/a/Pfexjhjb}. The latest presentation files in the \textbf{main} branch will be used to mark against the \textbf{Documentation} criterion. Partial marks \textbf{are not} given for functionality in other branches. Late submissions will incur a \textbf{10\% penalty per day}, rolling over at \textbf{5:00 PM}.

\section*{Extensions}
Familiarise yourself with the assessment due date. If you need an extension, contact the course lecturer before the due date. If you require more than a week's extension, a medical certificate or support letter from your manager may be needed.

\section*{Resubmissions}
Learners may be requested to resubmit an assessment following a rework of part/s of the original assessment. Resubmissions are to be completed within a negotiable short time frame \& usually \textbf{must} be completed within the timing of the course to which the assessment relates. Resubmissions will be available to learners who have made a genuine attempt at the first assessment opportunity \& achieved a \textbf{D grade (40-49\%)}. The maximum grade awarded for resubmission will be \textbf{C-}.

\section*{Resits}
Resits \& reassessments \textbf{are not} applicable in \textbf{ID721001: Mobile Application Development}.
