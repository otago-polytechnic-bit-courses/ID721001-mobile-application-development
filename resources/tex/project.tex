\section*{Assessment Overview}
In this assessment, you will develop \& publish a travelling application using \textbf{Kotlin} in \textbf{Android Studio} \& \textbf{Google Play Store}. \textbf{Android} topics such as \textbf{ViewModel}, \textbf{LiveData}, \textbf{Room Database} \& \textbf{Google Map} were formally covered in the teaching sessions. The main purpose of this assessment is not just to build a mobile application, rather to demonstrate your ability to effectively implement intermediate/advanced \textbf{Android} features \& other application development topics. In addition, marks will be allocated for code elegance, documentation \& \textbf{Git/GitHub} usage. \\

The travelling application will help you sound like a local \& adapt to a new culture. You will begin by selecting a country you wish to travel to. For example, if you wish to travel to Italy, you would be provided with all the necessary tools such as text translation \& text to speech support, a selection of well-known Italian phrases, an interactive quiz to test your knowledge of Italian culture \& a map containing locations of Italy's top-rated tourist attractions. A user of your travelling application \textbf{must} be able to select from at least \textbf{six} countries with at least \textbf{one} country per \href{https://www.worldometers.info/geography/7-continents/}{continent} \textbf{excluding} Antarctica. 

\section*{Learning Outcomes}
At the successful completion of this course, learners will be able to:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Implement \& publish complete, non-trivial, industry-standard mobile applications following sound architectural \& code-quality standards.
	\item Identify relevant use cases for a mobile computing scenario \& incorporate them into an effective user experience design.
	\item Follow industry standard software engineering practice in the design of mobile applications.
\end{enumerate}
