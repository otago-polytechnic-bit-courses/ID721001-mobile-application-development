\section*{Assessment Overview}
In this assessment, you will develop \& publish a travelling application using \textbf{Kotlin} in \textbf{Android Studio} \& \textbf{Google Play Store}. \textbf{Android} topics such as \textbf{ViewModel}, \textbf{LiveData}, \textbf{Room Database} \& \textbf{Google Map} were formally covered in the teaching sessions. The main purpose of this assessment is not just to build a mobile application, rather to demonstrate your ability to effectively implement intermediate/advanced \textbf{Android} features \& other application development topics. In addition, marks will be allocated for code elegance, documentation \& \textbf{Git/GitHub} usage. \\

The travelling application will help you sound like a local \& adapt to a new culture. You will begin by selecting a country you wish to travel to. For example, if you wish to travel to Italy, you would be provided with all the necessary tools such as text translation \& text to speech support, a selection of well-known Italian phrases, an interactive quiz to test your knowledge of Italian culture \& a map containing locations of Italy's top-rated tourist attractions. A user of your travelling application \textbf{must} be able to select from at least eight countries with at least one country per \href{https://www.worldometers.info/geography/7-continents/}{continent} \textbf{excluding} Antarctica. 

\section*{Learning Outcomes}
At the successful completion of this course, learners will be able to:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Implement \& publish complete, non-trivial, industry-standard mobile applications following sound architectural \& code-quality standards.
	\item Identify relevant use cases for a mobile computing scenario \& incorporate them into an effective user experience design.
	\item Follow industry standard software engineering practice in the design of mobile applications.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Conditions of Assessment}
You will complete this assessment during your learner managed time, however, there will be availability during the teaching sessions to discuss the requirements \& your progress of this assessment. This assessment has \textbf{two} due dates:
\begin{itemize}
	\item GitHub Gist data \& sketched wireframes - \textbf{12/08/2021}
	\item Application and other documentation - \textbf{05/11/2021}
\end{itemize}

\section*{Pass Criteria}
This assessment is criterion-referenced (CRA) with a cumulative pass mark of \textbf{50\%} over all assessments in \textbf{IN721: Mobile Application Development}.

\section*{Group Contribution}
All git commit messages must identify which member(s) participated in the associated work session. Proportional contribution will be determined by inspection of the commit logs. If the commit logs show evidence of significantly uneven contribution proportion, the lecturer may choose to adjust the mark of the lesser contributor downward by an amount derived from the individual contributions.

\section*{Authenticity}
All parts of your submitted assessment \textbf{must} be completely your work \& any references \textbf{must} be cited appropriately including, externally-sourced graphic elements. Provide your references in a \textbf{README.md} file. All media \textbf{must} be royalty free (or legally purchased) for educational use. Failure to do this will result in a mark of \textbf{zero} for this assessment.

\section*{Policy on Submissions, Extensions, Resubmissions \& Resits}
The school's process concerning submissions, extensions, resubmissions \& resits complies with \textbf{Otago Polytechnic} policies. Learners can view policies on the \textbf{Otago Polytechnic} website located at \href{https://www.op.ac.nz/about-us/governance-and-management/policies}{https://www.op.ac.nz/about-us/governance-and-management/policies}.

\section*{Submissions}
You \textbf{must} submit all program files via \textbf{GitHub Classroom}. Here is the URL to the repository you will use for your submission – \href{https://classroom.github.com/a/YvRoxlAh}{https://classroom.github.com/a/YvRoxlAh}. The latest program files in the \textbf{main} branch will be used to mark against the \textbf{Functionality} criterion. Please test your \textbf{main} branch application before you submit. Partial marks \textbf{are not} given for functionality in other branches. Late submissions will incur a \textbf{10\% penalty per day}, rolling over at \textbf{5:00 PM}.

\section*{Extensions}
Familiarise yourself with the assessment due date. If you need an extension, contact the course lecturer before the due date. If you require more than a week's extension, a medical certificate or support letter from your manager may be needed.

\section*{Resubmissions}
Learners may be requested to resubmit an assessment following a rework of part/s of the original assessment. Resubmissions are to be completed within a negotiable short time frame \& usually \textbf{must} be completed within the timing of the course to which the assessment relates. Resubmissions will be available to learners who have made a genuine attempt at the first assessment opportunity \& achieved a \textbf{D grade (40-49\%)}. The maximum grade awarded for resubmission will be \textbf{C-}.

\section*{Resits}
Resits \& reassessments \textbf{are not} applicable in \textbf{IN721: Mobile Application Development}.
