# 05: Tailwind CSS, App Icon and Splash Screen

## Getting Started

Create a new project using the following command:

```bash
npx create-expo-app 05-playground
```

## Tailwind CSS

**TailWind CSS** is a utility-first **CSS** framework that allows you to rapidly build custom user interfaces. It provides a set of pre-defined **CSS** classes that can be used to style your components. We will specifically use **NativeWind** which is built on top of **TailWind CSS** and is designed to work with **React Native**.

### Getting Started

To get started, install the following dependencies:

```bash
npm install nativewind
npm install -D tailwindcss@3.3.2
```

Run the following command to create a `tailwind.config.js` file.

```bash
npx tailwindcss init
```

### tailwind.config.js

In the `tailwind.config.js` file, you should see the following code:

```js
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

Add the following code to the `tailwind.config.js` file:

```js
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./App.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
    "./components/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
    "./screens/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
  ],
  // ...
};
```

### babel.config.js

In the `babel.config.js` file, add the following code:

```js
plugins: ["nativewind/babel"],
```

### App.jsx

In the `App.jsx` file, add the following code:

```jsx
import { StatusBar } from "expo-status-bar";
import { Text, View } from "react-native";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <View className="flex-1 items-center justify-center bg-white">
      <Text className="text-lg text-pink-500 font-bold">
        Open up App.js to start working on your app!
      </Text>
      <StatusBar style="auto" />
    </View>
  );
};

export default App;
```

Reload your application. You should see the following:

<img src="../resources/img/05/phone-1.png" width="250" height="444" />

## App Icon

In the `assets` directory, you should see two icon files:

- `adaptive-icon.png` - this is the icon that will be used on Android devices
- `icon.png` - this is the icon that will be used on iOS devices

### Getting Started

Navigate to <https://icon.kitchen>. This is a free online tool that allows you to generate icons for your application.

You have a variety of options to choose from and preview how your icon will look like on different devices.

![](../resources/img/05/web-1.png)

Here is example of an icon using clip art:

![](../resources/img/05/web-2.png)

Once you are happy with your icon, click on the **Download** button. This will download a zip file containing the icon files. Unzip the file and go to the `ios` directory. Rename the `AppIcon~ios-marketing.png` file to `icon.png`. Create a copy of the `icon.png` file and rename it to `adaptive-icon.png`. Copy both files to the `assets` directory.

Reload your application. You should see the following on the **Expo Go** home screen:

<img src="../resources/img/05/phone-2.png" width="250" height="444" />

## Splash Screen

A splash screen is a screen that appears when an application is loading. It is usually used to display the application logo.

### Getting Started

To get started, install the following dependency:

```bash
npm install expo-splash-screen
```

### App.jsx

In the `App.jsx` file, add the following code:

```jsx
// ...
import { useCallback, useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { hideAsync, preventAutoHideAsync } from "expo-splash-screen";

// Keep the splash screen visible while we fetch resources
preventAutoHideAsync();

const App = () => {
  const [isReady, setIsReady] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    const prepare = async () => {
      try {
        // Artificially delay for 5 seconds to simulate a slow loading
        await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 5000));

        // Other things may include fetching data, loading fonts, etc
      } catch (err) {
        console.log(err);
      } finally { // Note: finally is always executed
        setIsReady(true);
      }
    };
    prepare();
  }, []);

  const onLayoutRootView = useCallback(async () => {
    if (isReady) {
      // When the root view is loaded, hide the splash screen
      await hideAsync();
    }
  }, [isReady]);

  if (!isReady) {
    return null;
  }

  return (
    <View
      className="flex-1 items-center justify-center bg-white"
      onLayout={onLayoutRootView}
    >
      {/* ... */}
    </View>
  );
};

// ...
```

Reload your application. You should see the following:

<img src="../resources/img/05/phone-3.png" width="250" height="444" />

### app.json

In the `app.json` file, you should see the following:

```json
"splash": {
  "image": "./assets/splash.png",
  "resizeMode": "contain",
  "backgroundColor": "#ffffff"
},
```

Rename the `splash.png` file to `icon.png`. Update the `app.json` file to the following:

```json
"splash": {
  "image": "./assets/icon.png",
  "resizeMode": "contain",
  "backgroundColor": "#ffffff"
},
```

Reload your application. You should see the following:

<img src="../resources/img/05/phone-4.png" width="250" height="444" />

You will notice that the splash screen's background colour is not the same as the `icon.png` file's background colour. To fix this, update the `app.json` file to the following:

```json
"splash": {
  "image": "./assets/icon.png",
  "resizeMode": "contain",
  "backgroundColor": "#000000"
},
```

Reload your application. You should see the following:

<img src="../resources/img/05/phone-5.png" width="250" height="444" />

## Research Tasks

1. Using **Tailwind CSS**, style the `HomeScreen.jsx` file. It should look like the following:

<img src="../resources/img/05/research-task-1.png" width="250" height="444" />

2. Use the following resource to style the `Button` components on the `HomeScreen` - <https://docs.expo.dev/ui-programming/react-native-styling-buttons>

3. Use the following resource to create a toast - <https://docs.expo.dev/ui-programming/react-native-toast>

**Note:** You should have the necessary knowledge to start the **Project 1: Cookbook Application** assessment.
