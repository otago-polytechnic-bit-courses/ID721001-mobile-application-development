\section*{Assessment Overview}
In this \textbf{individual} assessment, you will develop a mobile application using \textbf{React Native} and \textbf{Expo}, and publish it to either \textbf{Google Play Store} or \textbf{Apple App Store}. In addition, marks will be allocated for code elegance, documentation and \textbf{Git/GitHub} usage. \\

The mobile application will help you sound like a local and adapt to a new culture. You will begin by selecting a country you wish to travel to. For example, if you wish to travel to Italy, you would be provided with all the necessary tools such as text translation and text to speech support, a selection of well-known Italian phrases and a map containing locations of Italy's top-rated tourist attractions. A user of your mobile application \textbf{must} be able to select from at least \textbf{six} countries with at least \textbf{one} country per \href{https://www.worldometers.info/geography/7-continents/}{continent} \textbf{excluding} Antarctica.

\section*{Learning Outcomes}
At the successful completion of this course, learners will be able to:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Implement and publish complete, non-trivial, industry-standard mobile applications following sound architectural and code-quality standards.
	\item Identify relevant use cases for a mobile computing scenario and incorporate them into an effective user experience design.
	\item Follow industry standard software engineering practice in the design of mobile applications.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Conditions of Assessment}
You will complete majority of this assessment during your learner-managed time. However, there will be time during class to discuss the requirements and your progress on this assessment. This assessment will need to be completed by \textbf{Friday, 10 November 2023} at \textbf{4.59 PM}.

\section*{Pass Criteria}
This assessment is criterion-referenced (CRA) with a cumulative pass mark of \textbf{50\%} over all assessments in \textbf{ID721001: Mobile Application Development}.

\section*{Authenticity}
All parts of your submitted assessment \textbf{must} be completely your work. Do your best to complete this assessment without using an \textbf{AI generative tool}. You need to demonstrate to the course lecturer that you can meet the learning outcome(s) for this assessment. \\
 
 However, if you get stuck, you can use an \textbf{AI generative tool} to help you get unstuck, permitting you to acknowledge that you have used it. In the assessment's repository \textbf{README.md} file, please include what prompt(s) you provided to the \textbf{AI generative tool} and how you used the response(s) to help you with your work. It also applies to code snippets retrieved from \textbf{StackOverflow} and \textbf{GitHub}. \\
 
 Failure to do this may result in a mark of \textbf{zero} for this assessment.

\section*{Policy on Submissions, Extensions, Resubmissions and Resits}
The school's process concerning submissions, extensions, resubmissions and resits complies with \textbf{Otago Polytechnic} policies. Learners can view policies on the \textbf{Otago Polytechnic} website located at \href{https://www.op.ac.nz/about-us/governance-and-management/policies}{https://www.op.ac.nz/about-us/governance-and-management/policies}.

\section*{Submission}
You \textbf{must} submit all project files via \textbf{GitHub Classroom}. Here is the URL to the repository you will use for your submission â€“ \href{https://classroom.github.com/a/d\_u8vXR5}{https://classroom.github.com/a/d\_u8vXR5}.  Create a \textbf{.gitignore} and add the ignored files in this resource - \href{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/main/Node.gitignore}{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/main/Node.gitignore}. The latest project files in the \textbf{master} or \textbf{main} branch will be used to mark against the \textbf{Functionality} criterion. Please test before you submit. Partial marks \textbf{will not} be given for incomplete functionality. Late submissions will incur a \textbf{10\% penalty per day}, rolling over at \textbf{5:00 PM}.

\section*{Extensions}
Familiarise yourself with the assessment due date. If you need an extension, contact the course lecturer before the due date. If you require more than a week's extension, a medical certificate or support letter from your manager may be needed.

\section*{Resubmissions}
Learners may be requested to resubmit an assessment following a rework of part/s of the original assessment. Resubmissions are to be completed within a negotiable short time frame and usually \textbf{must} be completed within the timing of the course to which the assessment relates. Resubmissions will be available to learners who have made a genuine attempt at the first assessment opportunity and achieved a \textbf{D grade (40-49\%)}. The maximum grade awarded for resubmission will be \textbf{C-}.

\section*{Resits}
Resits and reassessments \textbf{are not} applicable in \textbf{ID721001: Mobile Application Development}.
