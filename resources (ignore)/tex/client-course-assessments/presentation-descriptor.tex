\section*{Assessment Overview}
In this \textbf{individual} assessment, you will present the mobile application from the \textbf{Project: Client Application} assessment and answer follow up questions via a video recording.  

\section*{Learning Outcomes}
At the successful completion of this course, learners will be able to:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Implement and publish complete, non-trivial, industry-standard mobile applications following sound architectural and code-quality standards.
	\item Identify relevant use cases for a mobile computing scenario and incorporate them into an effective user experience design.
	\item Follow industry standard software engineering practice in the design of mobile applications.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Conditions of Assessment}
You will complete this assessment during your learner-managed time. However, there will be time during class to discuss the requirements and your progress on this assessment. This assessment will need to be completed by \textbf{Friday, 10 November 2023} at \textbf{4.59 PM}.

\section*{Pass Criteria}
This assessment is criterion-referenced (CRA) with a cumulative pass mark of \textbf{50\%} over all assessments in \textbf{ID721001: Mobile Application Development}.

\section*{Authenticity}
All parts of your submitted assessment \textbf{must} be completely your work. If you use code snippets from \textbf{GitHub}, \textbf{StackOverflow} or other online resources, you \textbf{must} reference it appropriately using \textbf{APA 7th edition}. Provide your references in the \textbf{README.md} file in your repository. Failure to do this will result in a mark of \textbf{zero} for this assessment.

\section*{Policy on Submissions, Extensions, Resubmissions and Resits}
The school's process concerning submissions, extensions, resubmissions and resits complies with \textbf{Otago Polytechnic} policies. Learners can view policies on the \textbf{Otago Polytechnic} website located at \href{https://www.op.ac.nz/about-us/governance-and-management/policies}{https://www.op.ac.nz/about-us/governance-and-management/policies}.

\section*{Extensions}
Familiarise yourself with the assessment due date. If you need an extension, contact the course lecturer before the due date. If you require more than a week's extension, a medical certificate or support letter from your manager may be needed.

\section*{Resubmissions}
Learners may be requested to resubmit an assessment following a rework of part/s of the original assessment. Resubmissions are to be completed within a negotiable short time frame and usually \textbf{must} be completed within the timing of the course to which the assessment relates. Resubmissions will be available to learners who have made a genuine attempt at the first assessment opportunity and achieved a \textbf{D grade (40-49\%)}. The maximum grade awarded for resubmission will be \textbf{C-}.

\section*{Resits}
Resits and reassessments \textbf{are not} applicable in \textbf{ID721001: Mobile Application Development}.

\section*{Instructions}
