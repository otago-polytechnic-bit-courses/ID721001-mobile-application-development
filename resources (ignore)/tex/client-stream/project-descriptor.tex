\section*{Assessment Overview}
In this \textbf{individual} assessment, you will develop a mobile application using \textbf{React Native} and \textbf{Expo}, and publish it to \textbf{Google Play Store} or \textbf{Apple App Store}. Also, you will present the mobile application and answer follow up questions via a video recording. In addition, marks will be allocated for code elegance, documentation and \textbf{Git} usage.

\section*{Learning Outcomes}
At the successful completion of this course, learners will be able to:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Implement and publish complete, non-trivial, industry-standard mobile applications following sound architectural and code-quality standards.
	\item Identify relevant use cases for a mobile computing scenario and incorporate them into an effective user experience design.
	\item Follow industry standard software engineering practice in the design of mobile applications.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Conditions of Assessment}
You will complete majority of this assessment during your learner-managed time. However, there will be time during class to discuss the requirements and your progress on this assessment. This assessment will need to be completed by \textbf{Friday, 10 November 2023} at \textbf{4.59 PM}.

\section*{Pass Criteria}
This assessment is criterion-referenced (CRA) with a cumulative pass mark of \textbf{50\%} over all assessments in \textbf{ID721001: Mobile Application Development}.

\section*{Authenticity}
All parts of your submitted assessment \textbf{must} be completely your work. Do your best to complete this assessment without using an \textbf{AI generative tool}. You need to demonstrate to the course lecturer that you can meet the learning outcome(s) for this assessment. \\
 
 However, if you get stuck, you can use an \textbf{AI generative tool} to help you get unstuck, permitting you to acknowledge that you have used it. In the assessment's repository \textbf{README.md} file, please include what prompt(s) you provided to the \textbf{AI generative tool} and how you used the response(s) to help you with your work. It also applies to code snippets retrieved from \textbf{StackOverflow} and \textbf{GitHub}. \\
 
 Failure to do this may result in a mark of \textbf{zero} for this assessment.

\section*{Policy on Submissions, Extensions, Resubmissions and Resits}
The school's process concerning submissions, extensions, resubmissions and resits complies with \textbf{Otago Polytechnic} policies. Learners can view policies on the \textbf{Otago Polytechnic} website located at \href{https://www.op.ac.nz/about-us/governance-and-management/policies}{https://www.op.ac.nz/about-us/governance-and-management/policies}.

\section*{Submission}
You \textbf{must} submit all project files via \textbf{GitHub Classroom}. Here is the URL to the repository you will use for your submission â€“ \href{https://classroom.github.com/a/yitUo0I6}{https://classroom.github.com/a/yitUo0I6}.  Create a \textbf{.gitignore} and add the ignored files in this resource - \href{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/main/Node.gitignore}{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/main/Node.gitignore}. The latest project files in the \textbf{master} or \textbf{main} branch will be used to mark against the \textbf{Functionality} criterion. Please test before you submit. Partial marks \textbf{will not} be given for incomplete functionality. Late submissions will incur a \textbf{10\% penalty per day}, rolling over at \textbf{5:00 PM}.

\section*{Extensions}
Familiarise yourself with the assessment due date. If you need an extension, contact the course lecturer before the due date. If you require more than a week's extension, a medical certificate or support letter from your manager may be needed.

\section*{Resubmissions}
Learners may be requested to resubmit an assessment following a rework of part/s of the original assessment. Resubmissions are to be completed within a negotiable short time frame and usually \textbf{must} be completed within the timing of the course to which the assessment relates. Resubmissions will be available to learners who have made a genuine attempt at the first assessment opportunity and achieved a \textbf{D grade (40-49\%)}. The maximum grade awarded for resubmission will be \textbf{C-}.

\section*{Resits}
Resits and reassessments \textbf{are not} applicable in \textbf{ID721001: Mobile Application Development}.
