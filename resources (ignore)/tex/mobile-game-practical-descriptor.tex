\section*{Assessment Overview}
In this \textbf{individual} assessment, you will develop 

\section*{Learning Outcomes}
At the successful completion of this course, learners will be able to:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Implement and publish complete, non-trivial, industry-standard mobile applications following sound architectural and code-quality standards.
	\item Identify relevant use cases for a mobile computing scenario and incorporate them into an effective user experience design.
	\item Follow industry standard software engineering practice in the design of mobile applications.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Conditions of Assessment}
You will complete majority of this assessment during your learner-managed time. However, there will be time during class to discuss the requirements and your progress on this assessment. This assessment will need to be completed by \textbf{Friday, 10 November 2023} at \textbf{4.59 PM}.

\section*{Pass Criteria}
This assessment is criterion-referenced (CRA) with a cumulative pass mark of \textbf{50\%} over all assessments in \textbf{ID721001: Mobile Application Development}.

\section*{Authenticity}
All parts of your submitted assessment \textbf{must} be completely your work. Do your best to complete this assessment without using an \textbf{AI generative tool}. You need to demonstrate to the course lecturer that you can meet the learning outcome for this assessment. \\
 
 However, if you get stuck, you can use an \textbf{AI generative tool} to help you get unstuck, permitting you to acknowledge that you have used it. In the assessment's repository \textbf{README.md} file, please include what prompt(s) you provided to the \textbf{AI generative tool} and how you used the response(s) to help you with your work. It also applies to code snippets retrieved from \textbf{StackOverflow} and \textbf{GitHub}. \\
 
 Failure to do this may result in a mark of \textbf{zero} for this assessment.

\section*{Policy on Submissions, Extensions, Resubmissions and Resits}
The school's process concerning submissions, extensions, resubmissions and resits complies with \textbf{Otago Polytechnic} policies. Learners can view policies on the \textbf{Otago Polytechnic} website located at \href{https://www.op.ac.nz/about-us/governance-and-management/policies}{https://www.op.ac.nz/about-us/governance-and-management/policies}.

\section*{Submission}
You \textbf{must} submit all program files via \textbf{GitHub}. The latest program files in the \textbf{master} or \textbf{main} branch will be used to mark against the \textbf{Functionality} criterion. Please test your \textbf{master} or \textbf{main} branch application before you submit. Partial marks \textbf{will not} be given for incomplete functionality. Late submissions will incur a \textbf{10\% penalty per day}, rolling over at \textbf{5:00 PM}.

\section*{Extensions}
Familiarise yourself with the assessment due date. If you need an extension, contact the course lecturer before the due date. If you require more than a week's extension, a medical certificate or support letter from your manager may be needed.

\section*{Resubmissions}
Learners may be requested to resubmit an assessment following a rework of part/s of the original assessment. Resubmissions are to be completed within a negotiable short time frame and usually \textbf{must} be completed within the timing of the course to which the assessment relates. Resubmissions will be available to learners who have made a genuine attempt at the first assessment opportunity and achieved a \textbf{D grade (40-49\%)}. The maximum grade awarded for resubmission will be \textbf{C-}.

\section*{Resits}
Resits and reassessments \textbf{are not} applicable in \textbf{ID721001: Mobile Application Development}.

\section*{Instructions}
You will need to submit a mobile game and documentation that meet the following requirements:

\subsection*{Documentation - Learning Outcomes 2, 3 (100\%)}
\begin{itemize}
	For each game, in a \textbf{Microsoft Word} document, explain the following:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Introduction
		\item Purpose - Define the purpose of UAT, which is to ensure that the mobile games meets the main features and mechanics.
		\item Scope - Outline the scope of UAT, including the main features and mechanics to be tested.
		\item Objectives - Validate that the mobile games are user-friendly, confirm that the mobile applications meet the main features and mechanics.

		\item Test Preparation
		\item Test Plan - Detail the testing strategy, scope, resources, schedule and deliverables.
		\item Test Cases - Develop test cases based on the main features and mechanics.
		\item Test Environment - Define the devices and operating systems for testing. For example, screen sizes, iOS versions and Android versions.
		
		\item Execution - Conduct functionality, usability and compatibility testing

		\item Evaluation
		\item Collect feedback from users regarding functionality, usability and overall experience. Use surveys or interviews.
		\item Document and prioritise any issues or bugs reported during testing. If so, provide steps to reproduce and screenshots.
		\item Retest any resolved issues or bugs to confirm that they have been fixed. Verify that no new issues or bugs have been introduced.
